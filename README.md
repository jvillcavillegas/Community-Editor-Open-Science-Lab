# Community-Editor-Open-Science-Lab
## Our mission is training Latin American scientists’ community to create high-quality open journals with good editorial standards
### Our initiative is called “Training Latin American scientists community to create high-quality open journals with good editorial standards”. We intend to build a community of native spanish speaking scientists who teach and learn about creating editorial boards and open access scientific journals that meet international high editorial quality standards. We intend to organise hands-on workshops about different steps in the editorial process of creating scientific open access journals, with experienced trainers and with open source tools. Some of the topics we would like to cover are:

### Acquiring ISSN code for online journals,
### Acquiring plug-ins for displaying online journal view statistics,
### Implementing DOIs for scientific articles,
### Implementing Ithenticate to stop plagiarism in articles submitted to the OJS system.
### These workshops would merge synchronic and asynchronic activities throughout a period of 6 weeks, so that trainees get to learn all the necessary concepts through, familiarize with the required software and conceptualize and brainstorm solutions to the local needs for the journals they intend to develop, with peer support and mentoring.
